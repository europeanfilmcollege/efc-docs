## Colour Space

To set the URSA 4.6K G2 up for grading, we want to shoot the footage in a flat colour profile.

To set it up, open up the menu and navigate to the **Record** tab. On the second page toward the top of the menu, you’ll find the section for selecting the “Dynamic Range”. Select **Film**.

If you are not going to grade the footage afterwards, just select video or extended video which is a slightly less contrasty version of video.

## Codec, Quality, & Resolution

The best way to record footage with the highest flexibility is to shoot it in Blackmagic RAW, however this might not be the best choice for you.

Pros:

- A lot more flexibility in post-production. The ISO and white balance that the footage was shot with doesn’t matter.
- Higher quality footage compared to the equivalent ProRes option at the same bitrate.
- A lot better results when chroma keying
