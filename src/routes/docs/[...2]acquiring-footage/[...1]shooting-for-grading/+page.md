If we’re going to grade the material it’s best to have the camera set up to store the files with a log gamma. This footage will look quite flat before processing and will need to go through a colour space transformation before it should be viewed.

You can also choose to shoot the material so it looks normal without any processing applied, but this footage is however not that flexible in post-production.
